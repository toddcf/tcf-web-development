Web design portfolio for Todd Croak-Falen.

## Future Iterations

- Landing Page:
  - Single page
    - No scrolling -- unless mobile responsiveness requires it. NEED TO FIX THIS. CURRENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW SCROLLING EVEN WHEN WINDOW RESIZES, SO IN SOME CASES YOU CANNOT SEE OR PRESS THE "ENTER" BUTTON.
  - h1: Test all mobile responsiveness so that my name NEVER breaks into two lines of text.
  - Footer: Copyright 2016 - currentYear.
- Portfolio Page:
  - Nav (links to each section below)
  - Section: UI/UX Projects.
  - Section: JavaScript Projects.
  - Section: React Projects (when completed).
    - Has the spinning React logo at the top of the section.
  - Section: Video Games (when completed).
  - Overall features to include:
    - One section will use a background video of code being typed.
    - Use sophisticated CSS styling for an impressive UI/UX.
    - Each project:
      - . . . is represented by a GIF instead of a still image.
      - . . . fades in when you scroll down.
      - At the bottom of the description, show the icons of each technology used. (JavaScript, HTML5, the spinning React logo, etc.)
        - Each one appears one after another, like the logos when you're signing into Google.
    - Mobile-responsive, of course.
