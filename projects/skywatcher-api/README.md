# Skywatcher
A weather forecasting app using AJAX and API.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
  - Typed.js (www.mattboldt.com)
- jQuery
- Twitter Bootstrap
- AJAX
- API (Open Weather Map)

## Future Iterations:
- Switch entire app over to Yahoo Weather API to solve the HTTPS issue with Heroku.
- UI:
  - Pressure: Add comma placeholders.
  - Temperature: No decimal places.
  - Capitalize the first letter of each word in data.weather[0].description.
  - Better color / image schemes.
    - Change background image/gif according to weather results.
  - Display the DAY OF THE WEEK in the table in place of the somewhat redundant WEATHER DESCRIPTION.
- UX:
  - Allow user to change units between C, F, and K using a dropdown.
  - Put "current" and "forecast" all on the same results page.
    - In fact, put everything on one page -- the home page.
